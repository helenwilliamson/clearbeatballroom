<h3><strong>Below are the questions we have been asked so far about our afternoon dances</h3>
<h4><strong>Will there be Bus Stop & Queue Dances?</strong></h4>
<p>No</p>
<h4><strong>Will there be Sequence Dancing?</strong></h4>
<p>It depends on who comes, if nobody wants sequence there will not be any. If some do there may be 2 or 3 and I hope that those who don’t do sequence will not mind having a rest for 6 or 9 minutes out of the 2 hours. If you really only want Sequence Dancing it is not for you.</p>
<h4><strong>Will there be Snowballs?</strong></h4>
<p>No</p>
<h4><strong>Is it a Tea Dance?</strong></h4>
<p>That depends on what you expect from a Tea dance. It is a dance in the afternoon and Tea is available. We purposefully called it a Social Dance rather than a Tea Dance so that people did not pre-judge it as something that it may or may not be.</p>
<h4><strong>Is Tea and Coffee included?</strong></h4>
<p>Tea, Coffee, cakes or biscuits are not included, and the price hopefully reflects this. They are available at the Hall’s café, which is reasonably priced and of good quality. Please do not brink you own drinks, other than water, it is a condition of our hire of the hall.</p>	
<h4><strong>What level of dancers are you expecting or targeting?</strong></h4>
<p>Dancers of any standard are welcome, as long as you like Ballroom and Latin dancing it does not matter if you are complete beginners or at Gold or beyond. The hall is large (225 M2 ) and I am sure we can accommodate everybody who wants to come. </p>
<h4><strong>Where is the hall?</strong></h4>
<p>It is at 122 Ladbroke Road, Redhill, RH1 1LF  NOTE ADD LINK</p> /* http://streetmap.co.uk/grid/528299_151205*/
<h4><strong>Is there parking?</strong></h4>
<p>There is ample parking, they have just changed the one way flow, you now enter to the left of the church and hall</p>
<h4><strong>How close do the buses stop?</strong></h4>
<p>It is less than half a mile from the Bus station but the 424 stops within 100 yards and several stop nearby on the A23 near Sutton and East Surrey Water Company.</p>
<h4><strong>Can you tell me a bit more about the hall?</strong></h4>
<p>It was built in 2013 and is a large hall with a sprung floor for more information see the church's website.  NOTE ADD LINK</p>
