Why is the website called Clear Beat?
</div>
<p>
When we startaed dancing we liked a clear beat, when we started to run a dance and set up the website I called it; Clearbeat.
</p><p>From the review of the music just over half of our music is vocals, but generally not ones where the singer's voice drowns out the music.
