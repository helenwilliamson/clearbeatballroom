About the Music
</div>
<p>
Review of the first year
</p><p>We have played 489 tracks of which 261 were vocals and 228 were instrumental
</p><p>No track has been repeated in the year, other than a Paso Doble by request, and is unlikely to be until month 15 when our good vocal Tangos and Waltzes will have been exhausted but for most it will be month 18 before we play a track for a second time.
</p><p>What we have played;
</p><p>Argentine Tango		0
<br/>Cha Cha Cha		68
<br/>Jive			23
<br/>Modern Jive/Le Roc	26
<br/>Paso Dobles		11
<br/>Quicksteps		71
<br/>Rumbas			69	
<br/>Sambas			19
<br/>Sequence			0
<br/>Slow Foxtrots		72
<br/>Tangoes			43
<br/>Viennese Waltzes		9
<br/>Waltzes			78
</p><p>We now use the hallâ€™s sound system, the acoustics of the hall are good and we hope that you will enjoy the music as much as we do.

Why is the website called Clear Beat?
</div>
<p>
When we strtaed dancing we liked a clear beat, when we started to run a dance and set up the website I called it; clear beat
</p><p>You will see from the left hand side that about half of our music is vocals, but generally not ones where the singers voice drowns out the music.
