Why Clear Beat Ballroom?
</div>
<p>
When we started dancing we danced at a variety of locations and it was very difficult to hear the beat to some music. So I lodged in my brain that if I was to run a dance there would be a clear beat.
</p><p>Things have moved on from there, I can pick up the beat better, even if I don’t (always) keep time to it. However, you still get some records; Skyfall is the latest fashionable one that you are meant to Rumba to, a challenge I sometimes rise to.

<p>
At the last back-up I had over 13,000 dance tracks. 
</p><p>I have rated them out of 15 (using a couple of criteria) and at the afternoon dances will only play those rated 14 or 15, there are over 600, with a playing time of 29 hours. If I were to run evening sessions I would include 12s & 13s for diversity, there are just under 3,000 rated 12 to 15 with a playing time of around 140 hours. 
</p><p>For dances I don’t do and therefore shouldn’t judge, such as Argentine Tango and Salsa I am grateful to others who do dance them for helping by rating them for me.
</p><p>If I were to play 6 Cha Cha Chas rated 14 or 15, once a month, I would not have to repeat one for over 14 months. If I were to play 6 Cha Cha Chas once a week, rated 12 to 15 I would not have to repeat one for over 15 months.
</p><p>A lot depends on taste, the sound system and the acoustics of hall but I hope that you will enjoy the music and have found this bit of background information interesting.
