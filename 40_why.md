Why Clear Beat Ballroom?
</div>
<p>
When we started dancing we danced at a variety of locations and it was very difficult to hear the beat to some music. So I lodged in my brain that if I was to run a dance there would be a clear beat.
</p><p>Things have moved on from there, I can pick up the beat better, even if I don’t (always) keep time to it. However, you still get some records; Skyfall is the latest fashionable one that you are meant to Rumba to, a challenge I sometimes rise to.

At the last back-up there were nearly 17,000 tracks, including a lot of duplicates.
</p><p>I have categorised the clarity of the beat from 1 to 5 regardless of whether I like the music or not. What gets put into each varies from one dance to another, for example for a Waltz; 
</p><p>1. is it really a Waltz?
</p><p>Jumping to 5. it has a 1, 2, 3 but more as a, Omph cha cha so that you can really feel the emphasis on the 1 rather than just hearing it louder.
</p><p>4. either has got a definite 1,2,3, but is plonky or leaves you guessing too much, but would be willing to dance to it.
</p><p>3. will have a clear 1,2,3 with a nice emphasis on the 1 or a really lovely 1 that carries you through the 2 and 3. 
</p><p>I can’t hand on heard say that I would categorise something the same today as I did a few years back but if I find something that does not fit I just alter the code.
</p><p>I have marked each as Vocal or Instrumental and have then picked the best of each so the most I will have of the same record, for the same dance,  is two, hence why so many duplicates, picking the best Cumparsita  from 48 was boring.
</p><p>Those with a Beat Clarity of 4 or 5 I rated on a 1 to 5 basis based on how much I liked them, I only play those that are rated 4 or 5. I have many that have a Beat Clarity of 4 but a Rating of 5 and vice versa, some that have a Beat Clarity of 5 only got rated a 3 or less, they are independent scores. The net result is that I have just under 3,000 tracks that I think have a good beat and I like so there can still be great variety. If I were to play 6 Cha Cha Chas a night, 1 night a week, I would not have to repeat one for over 15 months, similarly if I were to play 6 Cha Cha Chas rated 5, once a month, I would not have to repeat one for over 15 months.
</p><p>For dances I don’t do and therefore shouldn’t judge, such as Argentine Tango and Salsa I am grateful to others who do, for doing it for me.
</p><p>A lot depends on taste, the sound system and the acoustics of hall but I hope that you have found this bit of background information interesting.
