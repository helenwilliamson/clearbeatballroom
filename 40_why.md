Why Clear Beat Ballroom?
</div>
When we started dancing we danced at a variety of locations and it was very difficult to hear the beat to some music. So I lodged in my brain that if I was to run a dance there would be a clear beat.
Things have moved on from there, I can pick up the beat better, even if I don’t (always) keep time to it. However, you still get some; Skyfall is the latest fashionable one that you are meant to Rumba to, a challenge I sometimes rise to.
